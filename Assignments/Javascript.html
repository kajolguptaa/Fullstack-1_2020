        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
         time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying 
         timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics etc.It that enables you to create dynamically 
         updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.Alongside HTML and CSS, 
         JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.JavaScript enables interactive web pages and
          is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,
          and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
