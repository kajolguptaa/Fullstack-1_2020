       HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language,and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.Hypertext refers to 
       the way in which Web pages(HTML documents)are linked together.Thus,the link available on webpages is called Hypertext.
       As its name suggests,HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags
       that tell a web-browser how to structure it to display.Originally,HTML was developed with the intent of defining
       the structure of documents like headings,paragraphs,lists,and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific 
       information between researchers.
